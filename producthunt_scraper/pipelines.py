# Define your item pipelines here to manipulate (validate and process) the data we have scraped before saving it.
#
# Use item pipelines to do:
#   * Cast item value to their corresponding storage type i.e int, float, etc
#   * Drop incomplete item
#   * Drop duplicate item
#   * etc
#
# Don't forget to add your pipeline to the ITEM_PIPELINES setting
# See: https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/item-pipeline.html
